Even inexperienced teams can contain and eliminate the Chestburster with minimal loss of life. Unfortunately, during this phase, the Xenomorph displays an instinctive caution, avoiding all contact. Worse, if given time, the Chestburster will eat, molt, and grow into a full-sized drone."

During the first twenty minutes of a Xenomorph contamination, mortality rates are twenty to thirty times higher than the later stages of contamination."

However, when dealing with Xenomorphs, no system is foolproof. Sufficient damage to the circulation and waste flow systems could create the conditions for massive Xenomorph infiltration. For this reason, security should flush any contamination upwards - towards the office and living quarters sections - despite the certainty of increased short-term fatality counts."

Bottom line is we're cut off from the landing now, so it's up to him to get the beacon up and wave us home. He'd better hurry too. We're getting ghost readings on the motion trackers.

They've had fatalities in the Pod and lost contact with a large archeological team - two dozen scientists and laborers.

The floors are evacuated and sealed until chemical treatments can be applied. No guards get hurt that way. Of course, this takes time. I pity the man who fails to get out in time.

However, she is born quite humbly. Under the right pheromone conditions, runners and drones undergo a molting process extending over several years. During this time, the Xenomorph skin thickens and hardens. As the Praetorian enters mid-phase, it emits its own behavioral pheromone, which in turn enrages the Hive. Most Praetorians die during this phase. One strong enough to escape will wander the surrounding environs until her shell completes its hardening.

He was the only survivor. During the ensuing investigation, Rykov claimed that an invisible extraterrestrial massacred his team. The military tribunal did not believe this story, but neither did they find any specific misconduct. Rykov was honorably discharged, a decision that was widely criticized as too lenient.\n\nAfter this, his history becomes murky. The records indicate that he sustained severe spinal injuries, so his current health can be considered either miraculous or the result of neuro-regenerative therapy. In the latter case, he would still require daily doses of Sededrine, an illegal narcotic known for toxic and psychological side effects.\n\nIn any case, his recent behavior is suspect. While his mercenary missions have no doubt been effective, they have been accompanied by accusations of excessive brutality and corruption. Additional, unconfirmed reports charge Rykov with weapon smuggling and industrial espionage. \n\nGiven this history, he could prove vulnerable to blackmail and extortion, making him a weak security link.

    IDS_STORY_10866         "October 6, 2110. New Brazil\n\nRenowned geneticist Dr. Arnaud Eisenberg today announced a new enterprise focused on the eradication of disease through genetic alteration. Although Dr. Eisenberg described the scope of this enterprise as - ambitious - and -groundbreaking, - details remain somewhat sketchy, leaving many in the scientific community skeptical.\n\nHe's got funding and support, remarked Dr. Carlton Chambers, also an expert in the field of biogenetics, but it's not clear he has much else.\n\nToday's press conference at the palatial Eisenberg estate near New Brazil marks the doctor's first public appearance in almost four years, ending months of speculation about his whereabouts and well-being. Unconfirmed reports had placed him at the center of an interplanetary expedition from which he allegedly returned in cold sleep, barely alive and badly burned from an industrial accident. \n\nThe family's publicists have vehemently denied these and similar rumors, but perhaps the most convincing case can be made by the doctor's excellent health. When asked about his long silence, Dr. Eisenberg said, I've been busy.\n\nDr. Eisenberg is the son of Dr. Ernest Eisenberg and great grandson of Tomas Eisenberg, developer of the first cybernetic organism. The project is being financed by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. "

Just walking around causes our people to strain.\n\nWe've set up base camp in the broken lands south of the Hive. The synthetics have cleared the foliage and are currently adding a minefield and sentry gun emplacements. As I argued so often to the funding committee, human ingenuity conquers all."
    IDS_STORY_11156         "November 7\nThe Hive appears dormant. The remote rover has found evidence of the Xenomorph, but no active specimens. I have ordered the synths to begin explorations.\n\nThere is much evidence of the carrier species.  We call them - Pilots, - for lack of a better name.  Unexplained structures jut from the earth, and mysterious shafts vanish deep underground, all exhibiting the distinctive architecture of the ship from LV426. Although these archaeological remnants come as little surprise-we followed the ship's flight telemetry here, after all-I find it all a bit unnerving. \n\nStill, I shouldn't complain. It guarantees additional funding for the project.\n\n11.15\nThe synths have caught glimpses of Aliens smaller than those observed on LV426. I have named them Runners. They stray great distances from the Hive, especially at night. We are careful to return to the observation posts as a precaution, but they appear uninterested in us. They seem to be looking for something.\n\nThe Hive itself remains dormant. I believe this dormancy may be tied to the severe climatic conditions. Our initial analysis of the flora seems to corroborate this theory. But what are they waiting for? Cooler temperatures? Increased humidity? Or is it something else?"
    IDS_DIALOGUE_11157      "December 25\n     The Runners remain a cipher. Yesterday afternoon, they abruptly attacked Weller, but have since returned to their prior disinterest in us. The attack may have been prompted by his proximity to the Hive. \nIn any case, his death is a grim reminder not to let down our guard.\n\nFrom our remote probes, I have found that Runner activity appears linked to an increase in pheromone discharge from the Hive walls along with extremely high-frequency sound waves. Perhaps the covered cranium of the Alien may operate as a resonance chamber: boosting, receiving and transmitting their ultrasonic communications.  If this is so, the Runners would be required to remain close to the Hive in order to maintain their contact. If they ventured beyond this range, or if I could somehow block the Hive's communication, it might be possible to replace their orders with some of my own. An entertaining theory, at least. Yet I wonder, who commands them?"
    IDS_DIALOGUE_11158      "December 12\nThe horebush bloomed today. If my theories are correct, this means an end to dormancy. McCulloch, our security chief, insists that we must withdraw to a safer vantage. Nonsense, I say. We are here to observe and collect data. We must witness the transformation.\n\nDecember 14\nMcCulloch is having fits. He has found a device, very advanced technology, yet stylized with a tribal flair. It does not match the Pilot species. In fact, McCulloch thinks it is recent, less than a decade old. It appears to be a weapon.\n\nOf course, he's now terrified. I've tried to convince him what a tremendous opportunity this is. After all, we came to learn. \n\nStill, we will limit our risks. Radio traffic is being kept to a minimum and we shall camouflage as best we can. Better we spot them than they spot us."
    IDS_DIALOGUE_11159      "January 1\nHappy New Year. The Hive is awake.\n\nWe are stranded. Last night, our perimeter defenses were interrupted by the most severe storm we've seen thus far. It was as if they knew, for within minutes, their drones swept through our encampment, slaughtering everyone in their path and crippling our dropship.\n\nMcCulloch is gone. For what it's worth, he was brave at the end. \n\nThere are seventeen of us left, holed up inside Observation Post 2. If we stretch our rations, particularly the water, the supplies should last four or five days. By then, we'll have to break for OP3, toward the Hive. I estimate its remaining stores will buy us about a week. OP4 should hold us for an additional month.\n\nThat means two months without food before the next supply ship is due. If we can reach all of the observation posts, we might survive."
    IDS_DIALOGUE_11160      "January 5\nWe had to give up on OP3 today. Adams slipped and Green stopped to help her. We all feel guilty, but what could we have done except die with them? Besides, although no one has said it, there's now more food for the rest of us.\n\nI've told them that if we can hold out eight weeks, we'll probably be saved. It's a lie, but at least it keeps them together. The last thing we need is to start turning on each other.\n\nWe'll try for OP3 again tomorrow."
